## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 1. Layoffs Data Cleaning (SQL)

**Goal**: Clean a dataset of global tech layoffs to make it ready for analysis.

**Highlights**:
- Removed duplicate rows using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs
- Standardized inconsistent company, industry, and country names
- Converted date strings into proper `DATE` format
- Imputed missing industry values with self-joins
- Removed rows with incomplete layoff data

**Tools**: MySQL

### 🔹 2. Layoffs Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)
**Goal**: Analyze the cleaned layoffs dataset to extract insights and trends using SQL.

**Highlights**:
- Aggregated data by year, country, and company
- Used `DENSE_RANK` and window functions to find top layoffs per year
- Built rolling monthly layoff trends
- Identified extreme cases (e.g. 100% layoffs)
